# ToonTown-VP with AutoHotKey
By Josh Vincent

This is a script I created to make it easier for toon to throw a pie in the VP's under carriage in Toontown Rewritten.

## Usage
Download AutoHotkey from here: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ 

Once AHK is on your machine it should recognize the .ahk file. Double Click on the script in this folder to start it. A green "H" icon will appear in your taskbar when it is running. 

LeftAlt-J will give you a popup that shows you it is working. 

LeftAlt-K will Toggle the script from working or not. (This is so that you can throw normal pies too.. not just low ones)

Delete is the default key for you to throw the pie. When the script is enabled (Test w/ LeftAlt-J), it will throw pies very low. Otherwise, it should work as normal. 

I added in Single Quote (') for throwing pies as well. If you want, add whatever other key you want to trigger really fast. 

LeftAlt-L will punch in your username and password (that you can set in the script) and hit enter. This will be used when first opening the launcher.

Shift-L can be used to just type in the password and hit enter. This is for if the game crashed and the launcher still has your user name in the top field. 

## Other useful keys

Ctrl+Shift+R will reload the script, if you made a change to it. Such as changing the key for "Delete"

LeftAlt+Esc will close the script
