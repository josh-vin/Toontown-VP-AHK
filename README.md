# ToonTown-VP with AutoHotKey
By Josh Vincent

This is a script I created to make it easier for toon to throw a pie in the VP's under carriage in Toontown Rewritten.

## Usage
Double Click on the script in this folder to start it. 

Ctrl-J will give you a popup that shows you it is working. 

Ctrl-K will Toggle the script from working or not. (This is so that you can throw normal pies too.. not just low ones)

Delete is the default key for you to throw the pie. When the script is enabled (Test w/ Ctrl-J), it will throw pies very low. Otherwise, it should work as normal. 

## Other useful keys

Ctrl+Shift+R will reload the script, if you made a change to it. Such as changing the key for "Delete"

Ctrl+Esc will close the script
